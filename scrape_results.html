Unlike the Incoming Device Data (HL7 v2) interface, it doesn't store discrete instances of patient vitals. This interface requires the Inpatient/ICU advanced device license.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Referral%20Notification%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Referrals Notification</a></strong>: Transmits patient referral information to an external system, such as when a primary care provider refers a patient to a specialist. This is an HL7v2 interface. Most often, referrals are sent with the X12 278 interfaces.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5331'>Incoming Provider Communications Interface</a></strong>: Notifies Epic users of provider communications written in other systems.   Communications can have attached letters or documents and are routed to the recipient (Provider, Department, etc) based on preferences (In Basket, Fax, Mail, etc) the same as if the communication was written in Epic and routed with the Communication Management activity.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Asynchronous%20Acknowledgment%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Asynchronous Acknowledgement Interface</a></strong>: Sends asynchronous application acknowledgements in response to any incoming HL7v2 message received in Bridges, Epic's core messaging infrastructure.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5369'>Incoming External Appointments Interface</a></strong>: Receives HL7v2 scheduling messages about appointments that happen at an outside entity. These encounters can then be used by care managers to follow up with the patient or by Epic population health tools for analytics. This interface is different from the Incoming Appointment Scheduling interface in that it does not make appointments that can be acted upon (checked in, canceled, etc) or accessed from the clinical schedule to be charted in.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Provider%20Information%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Provider Information</a></strong>: Receives messages that can create, update, inactivate, or delete records in the provider master file, typically from an external credentialing system. While this interface can build the shell of a provider record, for example, address and contact information, this interface can't completely automate the addition of new providers to an organization because Epic has many settings and features that are built by association to provider records.   These settings cannot by nature be controlled by an external system. There are also use cases requiring provider records to be built that will not be tracked in a credentialing system.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2F360X%20Referrals%20Technical%20Specification.zip'>360 Exchange Closed Loop Referrals</a></strong>: 360 Exchange Closed Loop Referrals (360X) is an ONC-supported specification for referrals that allows the exchange of patient referral data between different EHR environments. Epic and non-Epic organizations whose EHR systems meet the specification’s requirements can exchange 360X referrals.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5778'>Incoming Medication Stock Reservation to Willow Inventory</a></strong>: Reserves medication stock for use at a specific inventory location.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Provider%20Information%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Provider Information</a></strong>: Sends provider information to an external system whenever a provider record is created, updated, inactivated, or deleted.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5364'>Incoming Financial Transactions</a></strong>: Receives financial transactions.

LRI format results follow the HL7 version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide: S&I Framework Lab Results Interface, Release 1. It can send both order status and result messages from Beaker to external systems, when Beaker is the reference lab for another LIS or clinical system. This interface can send result messages in the ELR format. ELR format results follow the HL7 version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide: Electronic Laboratory Reporting to Public Health, Release 1. This format is often used to notify public health agencies of tests which must be reported for disease tracking, and meet Meaningful Use (MU) or Promoting Interoperability (PI) measures in the U.S. This interface can send messages for pathology reports that contain electronic cancer checklists. These messages conform to the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) Standards for Cancer Registries Volume V rules for constructing HL7 messages for CAP electronic cancer checklist synoptic reporting. Use the LRI format unless you have a specific need to use the ELR or NAACCR formatted results. Note: Performing labs which are active participants in the Orders and Results Anywhere network use an interface that adheres to the same guidelines but has context aware connectivity to its consistituent ordering organizations without the need for a VPN or TCP/IP connection.  These specifications are located in "Orders and Results Anywhere".</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Surgical%20Cart%20Tracking%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Surgical Cart Tracking</a></strong>: After a surgical case is created, this interface files the identifier, current location, and transport status of the surgical carts that have been prepared for or assigned to the surgical case.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Infusion%20Orders%20and%20Incoming%20Infusion%20Verification%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Infusion Orders</a></strong>: Sends infusion order details to infusion pump gateways for the purposes of prepopulating infusion parameters on associated infusion pumps. When an infusion order message is sent on the Outgoing Infusion Orders interface, an immediate response is expected back from the infusion pump gateway via the Incoming Verification interface. These are advanced interfaces with a particular set of pre-requisites for successful implementation.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Patient%20Education%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Patient Education Interface</a></strong>: Integrates Epic's Patient Education activity with a third-party education content management or content delivery system.

This interface is used to send clinician-initiated education assignments to a third-party system so that the content can be viewed and acted upon there.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5375'>Incoming Deficiency Tracking</a></strong>: An HIM deficiency represents incomplete work by a provider. Receives and processes messages that can create or delete deficiencies, and update deficiency status and assigned providers. The interface adds external deficiency information in HIM when a deficiency is not automatically created by standard application functionality. This interface is useful if transcriptions are stored in an external system (obviating the need for an Incoming Transcription interface, which can also update deficiency statuses). The deficiency created by the interface can be configured to follow the rules defined in HIM for aging and delinquency or they can be controlled by an external system in a direct fashion. This interface also plays a key role if integrating with an external web-based deficiency system, receiving messages that allow a URL to be launched from the Chart Completion module.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5342'>Incoming Patient Administration</a></strong>: Receives messages for new or changed demographic information, visits (ADT), registration (guarantors and insurance coverage), allergies, and bed status updates.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Problem%20List%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Problem List</a></strong>: Used to add, modify, or remove problems from the patient-level problem list. This interface works specifically with the longitudinal problem list, not problems specific to a particular hospitalization. This integration has been implemented only for conversions.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Problem%20List%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Problem List</a></strong>: Sends notification of added, modified, or deleted problems from the patient-level problem list in the EHR to an external system. This interface works specifically with the longitudinal problem list, not problems specific to a particular hospitalization.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Clinical%20Observations%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Clinical Observations</a></strong>: Receives and processes clinical observations (past medical history, smoking history, and so on), that do not fit into other tools. This interface is typically used for filing clinical data for the purposes of a conversion. The Incoming Clinical Documentation Flowsheet interface is recommended if the data will be filed only to a documentation flowsheet.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Ancillary%20Orders%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Ancillary Orders</a></strong>: Sends orders placed by a clinical user in EpicCare to external ancillary systems - including messages for new orders, order cancellations, and number assignment responses to externally-initiated orders.  Use cases include:  Send physician placed orders to external laboratory, radiology or cardiology systems, when not using Epic equivalent product.  Send orders from Beaker, Epic's LIS, to an external LIS if test needs to be performed at another lab. Send orders to blood bank system from Beaker.  To send orders to both an external lab system (not to Beaker) and an external radiology system (not Radiant, Epic's RIS), two copies of the interface are needed, one for each purpose.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Medication%20Administration%20Notification%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Medication Administration Notification</a></strong>: Sends medication administration notification when a clinician marks a medication as administered on the MAR. This interface also sends updates regarding prior administrations, and change of status notifications for medications previously marked as administered. It does not send due times for medications that need to be administered in the future. The interface does not send messages when clinicians document the administration of blood products on the MAR or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) medications on a documentation flowsheet.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5280'>Outgoing Diet Orders</a></strong>: Sends information about new or canceled diet orders to an external nutrition system.

This is the only interface that sends orders or results from Radiant or Cupid. Messages are triggered for new orders when an order reaches a status of scheduled or arrived, changes to the status of an order, for results, and when the appointment associated with an order is canceled.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Blood%20Product%20Matching%20to%20BPAM%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Blood Product Matching to BPAM</a></strong>: This interface is included with the Blood Product Administration Module and facilitates matching (positive patient identification with blood) of blood products received from an external blood bank system.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Medication%20Orders%20to%20EpicCare%20Ambulatory%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Medication Orders to EpicCare Ambulatory</a></strong>: Receives medication order information from an external pharmacy system other than Willow Ambulatory. In the past, this interface was used only by an organization that maintained its own ambulatory pharmacy system and interfaced it with EpicCare Ambulatory EHR.   In its original implementation mode, this interface encodes and cancels orders, tracks and cancels dispenses, and requests the originator of a refill order. However, since external pharmacy systems have now moved to NCPDP/e-prescribing workflows, this interface is no longer implemented in real time, and is sparingly used for certain types of electrnoic conversions (see Patient Abstractor for preferred method of converting at home medications).  Note that this interface cannot be used to receive medications from an external Hospital Information System and file them for use with Willow Inpatient, nor can it file medication administration information discretely to the electronic MAR.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Medication%20Orders%20from%20EpicCare%20Ambulatory%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Medication Orders from EpicCare Ambulatory</a></strong>: Sends ambulatory medication orders that are placed in Order Entry to an external pharmacy system internal to the organization other than Willow Ambulatory Pharmacy. Messages are triggered as a user orders, discontinues, or reorders a medication.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5210'>Outgoing Scanned Document Link Maintenance</a></strong>: Sends updated document link keywords to an external document management system (DMS) when key information about where the content is located changes, for example, if a scan that originated in the DMS is moved from one encounter to another by HIM Chart Correction processes.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Results%20from%20Lab%20Instruments%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Results from Lab Instruments</a></strong>: Receives test results from instruments into Beaker, Epic's LIS. This is also the interface to use to receive point of care testing results, such as from docked glucometer systems, into Beaker.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FOutgoing%20Orders%20to%20Lab%20Instruments%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Outgoing Lab Instrument Orders</a></strong>: Sends information about new or canceled laboratory orders from Beaker, Epic's LIS, to an instrument. This is also the interface to use for Point of Care testing with Beaker, for example, docked glucometer systems. It can trigger messages when a new specimen is received, a test is reordered, an add-on test is ordered for a specimen that has already been received, or a test is canceled.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Orders%20from%20CPOE%20Systems%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Orders from CPOE Systems</a></strong>: Receives orders from external ordering systems. The interface can create, update, or cancel orders. Common use cases are routing lab orders to Beaker (Epic's LIS), radiology orders to Radiant (Epic's RIS), or cardiology orders to Cupid (Epic's CVIS).  Some integrations may additionally require either an Incoming Patient Administration interface to create or update patient records or an incoming query to look up patient information before sending the order message.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5354'>Incoming Medication Dispenses and Load/Unload from ADS to Willow Inpatient</a></strong>: Processes dispense, return, and waste information from medication cabinet systems (automated dispense systems), dispensing workflow engines, and robots.  Also processes "load/unload" messages received when a drawer, pocket, or bin is emptied or stocked.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5200'>Outgoing Verified Medication Orders from Willow Inpatient</a></strong>: Sends verified pharmacy orders. This interface is typically used with cabinet, robotic, TPN, or carousel dispensing systems. It is sometimes used to transmit medication orders to an external medical record or surgery system. Messages are triggered from Willow Inpatinet Pharmacy when a user verifies, re-verifies, discontinues, or modifies an order, reverses a discharge, changes a patient's location such that the dispense location changes, or loads a medication into a station that did not previously contain that medication. We recommend one interface for cabinets and a separate interface for robotic dispensing systems, since the requirements for message content varies between systems, as the robot is dispensing multiple doses of a given medication for a cart, whereas the cabinet order will be dispensed by a user.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5238'>Outgoing Patient Administration</a></strong>: Informs external systems of new patient creation, changes to patient demographic information, visits (ADT), registration (guarantors and insurance coverage), allergies, and bed status updates. These messages are triggered from many of Epic's applications. The ability to send allergy updates is only available from the Allergy activity. This interface does not send final coded diagnoses, procedures, or DRGs after a hospital account is coded.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5270'>Outgoing Formulary Information to ADS from Willow Inpatient Interface</a></strong>: Also known as ADS Console Management. The interface can be used to populate the master medication list of an automated dispense system when a medication is added or removed from the Willow Inpatient Pharmacy formulary.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5372'>Incoming EOB Scanning</a></strong>: Receives messages that notify the billing applications (Resolute Hospital, Professional, Home Health (Dorothy), or Enterprise Billing) that a scanned explanation of benefits document exists. Receiving a message opens a new payment batch in the appropriate billing application based on scan type.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20Device%20Data%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming Device Data</a></strong>: Receives discrete measurements from patient monitoring and documentation devices. The messages file to the application, where the data can be validated by the user and added to the chart, or in the case of surgical procedures, can be set to automatically validate and file to the chart. This type of integration is usually done with device aggregators to file samples from continuous physiological monitoring. It is not  used for consumer-initiated monitoring or home monitoring. Test your implementation with our  HL7 V2 Validator .</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=staged%2FIncoming%20MPI%20and%20Demographics%20Query%20Interface%20Technical%20Specification.pdf'>Incoming MPI and Demographics Query</a></strong>: Receives and responds to queries for demographic data from an external system when Epic is the EMPI.

The kiosk sends an image of the signature to the document management system, which in turn creates a reference to the signature document within the EHR.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5408'>Credit Card and Bank Account Integration</a></strong>: Epic provides support for credit cards to be used with the Epic system to pay copays, hospital and outpatient bills, and for medications. This integration is handled through credit card gateway systems, which send payment data to processing services that verify the payments with appropriate banks. The gateway then sends the verified payment information back to the Epic system to post the payment. This integration is handled through the patient portal and patient kiosk software as well as in over-the-phone and billing-office use cases. Epic software for credit card processing follows the PA-DSS requirements in its development.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5393'>Tapestry Document Linker DMS Integration</a></strong>: This web service allows third-party DMS vendors to launch activities within a pre-existing Hyperspace instance to link documents to records in Epic such as claims or coverages.

The web service can also launch a new Hyperspace instance if one is not open when the web service is called.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5412'>Credit Card and Check Scanning Device Integration</a></strong>: In addition to the Credit Card and Bank Account Integration specification, Epic provides separate and additional support for non-keyboard emulation credit card devices. This integration is handled through an interface between Epic and your gateway software. The gateway software integrates with the device and provides Epic with transaction results for the credit card payment. This integration is handled through the patient kiosk and by front desk personnel during check-in or check-out. This interface is supplemental to the generic credit card interface described above and should be implemented in addition to that interface if you want to provide support for EMV devices.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5376'>Incoming Computer-Telephony Integration</a></strong>: Epic integrates with your organization’s phone system to automatically open the appropriate chart or another activity in Epic when calls are received.</li><li><strong><a href='https://open.epic.com//Tech/TechSpec?spec=5283'>Outgoing Computer-Telephony Integration</a></strong>: Epic integrates with your organization’s phone system so users can place or end a call directly from a patient chart or another activity in Epic, and details about the call are logged.
